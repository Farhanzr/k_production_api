## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## How to run the project
Here are steps to be taken to run the project successfully:

1) git clone https://github.com/Farhanzr/k_production_api.git to your local. Note: Make sure you have git installed locally on your computer first.
2) Once this runs, you will have a copy of the project on your computer.
3) cd into your project and open the terminal to run the following commands.
4) Install Composer Dependencies. Run "composer install" without "".
5) Just like how we must install composer packages to move forward, we must also install necessary NPM packages to move forward. Now run "npm run dev" without "".
6) Create a copy of your .env file. Run this command "cp .env.example .env" without "".
7) Generate an app encryption key. Run this command "php artisan key:generate" without "".
8) Create an empty database for the project using the database tools you prefer.
9) In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database. Fill in the DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD options to match the credentials of the database you just created.
10) Migrate the database. Simply run "php artisan migrate" without "".
11) Once done migrating, you can run the program. I recommend you to use this command "php artisan serve --host=localhost --port=8080"
12) Open Postman API, and enter this link http://localhost:8055/api/register-employee and make sure method is POST.
13) Go to Body selection and choose form-data radio button.
14) Insert key as these : name, identity_no, phone, email, department. Then, insert the value according to your preferences.
15) Click send to store the data.
16) To view the registered employee, enter this link http://localhost:8080/api/employee-list and make sure method is GET.
17) To edit selected employee, enter this link http://localhost:8055/api/post-edit?profile={{uuid}} and make sure method is POST. Please note that the {{uuid}} value can be obtained from Employee's table.
18) To delete selected employee, enter this link http://localhost:8055/api/delete-employee?profile={{uuid}} and make sure method is POST. Please note that the {{uuid}} value can be obtained from Employee's table.
19) That's all the program can done. Thank you.
